# Bollinger Bands Strategy — Bybit USDT Perpetual Futures

A backtesting toolkit + testnet trading bot for a Bollinger Bands strategy on
Bybit USDT perpetual futures: 4 strategy variants, a fee/slippage/funding-aware
backtester, walk-forward optimization, Monte Carlo robustness checks, and a
WebSocket bot for Bybit's testnet.

## How it works

Bollinger Bands use a moving average ± a multiple of standard deviation as
dynamic support/resistance:

- Upper band = SMA + `nbdevup`×σ, Lower band = SMA − `nbdevdn`×σ
- **BUY** when price crosses above the upper band (breakout continuation)
- **SELL** when price crosses below the lower band (breakdown continuation)
- 4 variants ship with different entry/exit logic — see
  [Strategy variants](#strategy-variants)

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Backtest one variant on the bundled BTCUSDT sample data
python main.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --variant basic

# All 4 variants side by side
python main.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --all-variants

# Independent correctness checks (no look-ahead, PnL math, edge cases)
python verify_backtest.py
python test_edge_cases.py

# Walk-forward (out-of-sample) validation
python walk_forward.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --strategy basic

# Monte Carlo robustness check (trade-order permutation + bootstrap)
python monte_carlo.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --strategy basic
```

Only `klines/BTCUSDT-1h-2024-01-2025-06.csv` is bundled to keep the repo
small. Any other `--symbol`/`--interval`/date range downloads and caches
automatically from Bybit's public REST API on first use (no API key needed
for historical klines).

### Live testnet bot

The bot only ever runs against Bybit's **testnet** unless you explicitly pass
`--mainnet` — and even then, `--live` is required to place real orders.
Without `--live` it's a dry run that prints signals but sends nothing.

```bash
# Free — no funded account needed to create testnet API keys:
# https://testnet.bybit.com/app/user/api-management
export BYBIT_TESTNET_API_KEY=your_key
export BYBIT_TESTNET_API_SECRET=your_secret

# Dry run — prints signals only, places nothing
python live_testnet.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --variant basic

# Real orders on TESTNET (fake money) — trades the actual strategy signal
python live_testnet.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --variant basic --live

# Connectivity/order-placement smoke test only — ignores the strategy signal
# entirely and force-opens alternating positions every candle. Dry-run only;
# the bot refuses to combine --debug with --live.
python live_testnet.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --debug
```

`--mainnet-data` uses mainnet for price data while still trading on testnet
(some symbols have thin/fake data on testnet) — data source and order
destination are independent flags on purpose.

## Architecture

```
REST API (klines, on startup)  ──→  warm up BB/RSI state from history
                                          │
WebSocket: kline stream  ──→  on candle CLOSE (once per bar)  ──→  recompute
                               BB/RSI  ──→  evaluate ONE signal  ──→  order
                                          │
                               on every tick (in between closes)
                               ──→  price display only, no signal logic
                                          │
REST API  ──→  market order (entry) + SL algo order + TP algo order
```

Signals are evaluated **once per closed candle**, using that candle's final
close — exactly matching how the backtester evaluates each bar. Live ticks
between candle closes are shown for visibility but never trigger a trade
decision; earlier drafts of this bot recomputed signals on every tick, which
let live behaviour drift from what was actually backtested. If you're
reviewing this code, `on_candle_close()` in `live_testnet.py` is the only
place order decisions are made.

## Strategy variants

| Variant | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| `basic` | BB crossover: BUY above upper band, SELL below lower band |
| `rsi_filter` | BB crossover + RSI confirmation (RSI>55 for BUY, <45 for SELL) |
| `squeeze` | Only trades breakouts following a period of below-average BB width |
| `mean_reversion` | Enter on band touch, exit at the middle band (fades the move) |

## Backtest results: BTCUSDT 1h (2024-01 → 2025-06)

Reproduce with `python main.py --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1h --all-variants`
or see `sample_output/btcusdt_all_variants.txt`.

| Variant | Return | Sharpe | Win Rate | Trades | Max DD | Profit Factor |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| basic | -21.25% | -0.58 | 36.1% | 460 | -31.40% | 0.91 |
| rsi_filter | -16.71% | -0.43 | 36.3% | 441 | -27.9% | 0.94 |
| squeeze | -20.90% | -1.15 | 32.3% | 127 | -22.0% | 0.72 |
| mean_reversion | -99.94% | -21.2 | 22.9% | 1657 | -99.94% | 0.18 |

**None of these are profitable at realistic Bybit fees.** `mean_reversion`
essentially blows up the account (very tight take-profit relative to stop
distance and fees). This is disclosed, not hidden — it's included so you can
see the harness handles a clearly-losing strategy sanely, and so nobody
mistakes this repo for a "this makes money" claim.

`sample_output/` also has a full `walk_forward.py` and `monte_carlo.py` run
on BTCUSDT/basic, generated by the code in this repo exactly as it stands —
both agree with each other and with the table above (compound OOS return
roughly -6% to -20% depending on the test, 0% of Monte Carlo permutations
profitable). That agreement across three independent methods is itself a
useful sanity check on the tooling, even though the underlying answer here
is "this doesn't work on BTCUSDT."

## What's actually verified

I (Claude) read every file in this repo, then independently re-ran the
tooling rather than trusting the numbers as given:

- **No look-ahead bias**: indicators at bar `i` only use data up to and
  including bar `i`; entries execute at that same bar's close (with
  slippage), never a future bar.
- **Deterministic**: re-running the backtest reproduces the exact same
  numbers every time.
- **PnL math is internally consistent** — `verify_backtest.py` independently
  recomputes return from the trade log and cross-checks it against the
  backtester's own reported stats.
- `test_edge_cases.py` passes on flat markets, single spikes, pure
  trends, and forced SL/TP hits (these are smoke tests, not exhaustive
  proofs — worth strengthening if you extend the strategy).
- No SQL injection risk in `db.py` (parameterized queries throughout), and
  no API keys or secrets are hard-coded anywhere in this repo.

## Before you risk real money

Things this repo does **not** protect you from — read before connecting a
funded account:

- **Selection bias across many symbols.** Backtesting a strategy across
  hundreds of pairs and then picking the best performers (via `batch_fast.py`)
  will always surface a handful of "winners" even for a strategy with zero
  real edge, purely from testing that many hypotheses at once. A good
  Sharpe ratio on the single best symbol out of 200+ is not, by itself,
  evidence of a real edge — you'd need to validate that symbol's parameters
  on data the selection process never saw.
- **Walk-forward windows are limited by how much history you have.** With
  ~18 months of data and a 6–12 month training window, you only get a
  handful of out-of-sample test windows. Treat a "2 out of 2 profitable
  windows" result as a weak signal, not proof of robustness — the sample
  size is tiny either way.
- **Monte Carlo here tests path-dependency of the trades you already got,
  not whether the strategy has genuine predictive edge.** It answers "is
  this specific set of trades sensitive to their order/composition?", not
  "will this work going forward on data it hasn't seen." Useful, but it's
  one piece of evidence, not a verdict — and it will happily give you a
  polished, precise-looking "ROBUST" verdict for a strategy that isn't.
  (An earlier version of `monte_carlo.py` in this project actually had a bug
  that double-accumulated the equity curve and inflated every number in the
  permutation test — always worth distrusting a suspiciously clean result
  and going to re-derive it by hand, which is how that one was caught.)
- **No exchange liquidation modeling.** The backtester simulates your own
  stop-loss order, not Bybit's maintenance-margin liquidation engine. At
  high leverage, a fast enough move against you can liquidate the position
  before your stop-loss order fills, especially on lower-liquidity
  altcoins — that outcome is worse than anything in this backtest.
  Position sizing here is risk-based (caps risk at `risk_pct` of capital
  given the stop distance), which keeps typical implied leverage well below
  the `leverage` cap — but check the actual notional/leverage a signal
  produces before trusting it blind, especially in tight-range (squeeze)
  conditions.
- **Fees, slippage, and funding are estimates, not guarantees.** Confirm
  your account's actual fee tier, and remember slippage gets worse in low
  liquidity or during volatility spikes, not just on average.
- **This backtests one pair's specific 18-month window.** Markets change
  regimes; nothing here validates forward performance.

None of this means "the code is broken" — the mechanics check out (see
above). It means: treat any backtest, walk-forward, or Monte Carlo output
as one data point to interrogate, not a green light. If you do decide to
run this live, start on testnet, then with real money only at a size you
can afford to lose entirely, and monitor it closely.
