The goal of this project is to design and implement a **market-neutral long/short hedging strategy** with a **beta coefficient close to 0**.  
This minimizes exposure to overall market volatility (especially Bitcoin’s dominance in crypto markets) while allowing us to profit from **relative value differences** between correlated assets.

This work builds upon my previous GitHub project — [**Cointegrated Pairs Trading Bot**](https://github.com/dkalenov/Cointegrated-Pairs-Trading-bot) — where I developed a Python-based trading bot that identifies and trades cointegrated cryptocurrency pairs using **statistical arbitrage** and **mean-reversion** logic.  
The current project extends that concept toward **beta-neutral portfolio management**.

**Why Cointegration**

**Cointegration-based approach** allows to identify assets that move together in the long term but diverge temporarily in the short term.  
These temporary deviations offer **statistically measurable mean-reversion opportunities**.

Unlike correlation, cointegration ensures a **stationary linear relationship** between assets — allowing robust entry/exit decisions based on **z-scores** and **half-life estimates**.  
This method naturally provides **hedging** since long and short positions offset each other, reducing exposure to overall market movements.



## ****Implementation Plan****





**1. Data Preparation**

- Load and clean historical **kline (candlestick)** data for top cryptocurrencies.  
- Ensure all symbols share a unified time index, removing missing or duplicate candles.

---

**2. Beta Analysis**

- Estimate how strongly each cryptocurrency depends on **Bitcoin (BTC)** using log returns.


---

**3. Cointegration Scanning**

- Apply the **Engle–Granger two-step test** to detect statistically significant, mean-reverting long-term relationships.  
- Evaluate all symbol pairs for cointegration.  
- Retain only pairs that meet strict selection criteria:

  - p-value < 0.05  
  - Half-life < 200 bars  
  - Pair beta vs BTC ≈ 0  

---

**4. Z-Score and Signal Generation**

Compute the rolling z-score of each pair’s spread:


**Define trading signals:**

- **Go Long:**  z ≤ −2  
- **Go Short:** z ≥ +2  
- **Exit:** |z| ≤ 0.5  

Entries occur at statistical extremes; exits near equilibrium.

---

**5. Pair-Level Beta Calculation**

Identify combinations of assets which joint spread shows minimal dependency on BTC (**target β ≈ 0**).

---

**6. Position Sizing and Risk Management**

Apply **volatility parity** to balance exposure between both legs:



**Limit exposure:**

- Max notional per pair = **5% of total capital**  
- Max risk per pair = **1% of total capital**  
- Maintain **portfolio beta near zero** relative to BTC.

---

**7. Backtesting and Evaluation**

Run backtests on **≥ 1.5 years of hourly data**.

Track performance metrics:

- **CAGR** (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  
- **MDD** (Maximum Drawdown)  
- **CAGR/MDD > 1.5**  
- **Sharpe ratio** and **beta vs BTC**

Save trade logs, equity curves, and performance reports.

---

**8. Optimization and Diversification**

- Evaluate sensitivity for **z-entry/z-exit thresholds**, **lookback windows**, and **volatility weighting**.  
- Combine multiple low-correlated cointegration models into a diversified **market-neutral portfolio**.  
- Periodically re-train and re-evaluate cointegration pairs to adapt to market changes.  
- Monitor overall **portfolio beta** to maintain neutrality.

---

**9. Conclusion and Next Steps**

- **Parameter optimization:** Tune z-score thresholds, lookback windows, and half-life using grid search or Hyperopt.  
- **Advanced backtesting:** Extend the tester to stream data window-by-window to simulate live conditions.  
- **Dynamic adaptation:** Detect changes in cointegration; exit trades if relationships decay.  
- **Multi-timeframe analysis:** Explore cross-timeframe cointegration opportunities.  
- **Trade management:** Test partial take-profits, trailing stops, and dynamic stop adjustments.  
- **Integration:** Connect to Binance Futures WebSocket for real-time paper trading, then transition to live execution.





 #**Beta Analysis** | **Concept Overview**

In classical finance, the **Beta (β)** coefficient measures how strongly an asset’s returns move relative to the overall market.  
It quantifies the *systematic risk* — the portion of total risk that cannot be diversified away.

Mathematically, it is defined as:

$$
\beta = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\mathrm{Var}(R_m)}
$$

Where:

- **Rᵢ** — returns of the individual asset  
- **Rₘ** — returns of the market portfolio (e.g., S&P 500)  
- **Cov(Rᵢ, Rₘ)** — covariance between the asset and the market  
- **Var(Rₘ)** — variance of the market returns

A high β (>1) indicates that the asset amplifies market movements,  
while a low β (<1) means it moves less than the market.  
A β close to 0 implies that the asset behaves independently of market swings — **market-neutral**.

**Application to Cryptocurrencies**

In the cryptocurrency market, **Bitcoin (BTC)** plays the role of the *market benchmark*.  
Hence, we can rewrite the same formula as:

$$
\beta_i = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(r_i, r_{BTC})}{\mathrm{Var}(r_{BTC})}
$$

Where:

- **rᵢ** — log returns of cryptocurrency *i*  
- **r₍BTC₎** — log returns of Bitcoin  
- **Cov(rᵢ, r₍BTC₎)** — covariance between the coin and Bitcoin  
- **Var(r₍BTC₎)** — variance of Bitcoin’s returns

This approach is inspired by the beta analysis framework presented in
**[“Cryptocurrency market structure: beta, correlations and risk” (arXiv:1808.02505)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02505)**.

**Hypotheses**


- **H₀:** There is **no significant dependence** between an altcoin’s returns and Bitcoin’s returns (β = 0).  
- **H₁:** The altcoin’s returns are **significantly correlated** with Bitcoin’s returns (β > 0.5).  

In practice, we are particularly interested in assets (or pairs) for which **β ≈ 0**,   indicating weak market dependence and suitability for **market-neutral hedging**.
