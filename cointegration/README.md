The goal of this project is to design and implement a **market-neutral long/short hedging strategy** with a **beta coefficient close to 0**.  
This minimizes exposure to overall market volatility (especially Bitcoin’s dominance in crypto markets) while allowing us to profit from **relative value differences** between correlated assets.

This work builds upon my previous GitHub project — [**Cointegrated Pairs Trading Bot**](https://github.com/dkalenov/Cointegrated-Pairs-Trading-bot) — where I developed a Python-based trading bot that identifies and trades cointegrated cryptocurrency pairs using **statistical arbitrage** and **mean-reversion** logic.  
The current project extends that concept toward **beta-neutral portfolio management**.
