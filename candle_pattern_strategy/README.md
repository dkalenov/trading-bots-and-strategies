A candlestick pattern strategy is a technical analysis approach that uses the shapes and formations of candlesticks on a chart to predict future price movements. 
Traders look for recurring patterns formed by one or more candles to identify potential reversals, continuations, or periods of indecision, which helps them make informed buy and sell decisions.
