What Are Candlestick Patterns?

A candlestick represents price movement within a specific time period (e.g., 1h, 4h, 1d). Each candlestick has:
- Open – price at the start of the period
- Close – price at the end of the period
- High – highest price reached
- Low – lowest price reached


Candlestick patterns are combinations (usually 1–3 candles) that indicate possible continuation or reversal of the current trend.


How Candlestick Pattern Strategies Work
- Traders use these patterns to identify:
- Reversals (when a trend may change direction)
- Continuations (when the trend is likely to keep going)
- Indecision (when neither bulls nor bears are in control)

They’re often combined with:
- Support/resistance zones
- Trendlines or moving averages
- Volume confirmation
- Indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
